wikibot.py:
This one's for posting automatic scheduled Cointest posts, and it's controlled from the wiki. BTW don't take my variable names seriously, they're just random

votemanipulation.py:
is what CryptoChief asked me to work on to detect (you guessed it) vote manipulation in r/CC. It uses my sentiment.py as a dependency. It's a work in progress and still has a few bugs.

Cointestpromoter.py:
This is the bot to change the way Cointest-promoting comments are made, and the criteria for them to be made. As you can see it's pretty manual, especially the dictionary with trigger words

don't use CointestBot.py which was on my home directory because it doesn't work properly, use Cointest.py instead.
